Problems that touch hardware and low-level systems tend to stick with me. At Raptee.HV that usually means making our electric bikes behave: backend services in Go, embedded Linux applications, Dart FFI, UNIX sockets, TCP, and Protobuf. I ship backend pipelines and Flutter UIs that run on AGL boards and are tuned for the constraints they have.

**In my me-time**  
I take the same approach to side projects. Hack a prototype in an evening, dig into an odd protocol, or wire up something that never existed before. If it needs to be ready tomorrow, there is a good chance it will be done tonight.  
(Like a True Saiyan)

**How I work**  
I aim for just enough structure to ship quickly and just enough polish so the thing lasts. I am equally at home drawing up a system design as I am debugging a stubborn process in `htop`.

**Highlights**
- Architect and ship production systems for embedded Linux boards  
- Build backend services and pipelines in Go  
- Integrate low-level systems via Dart FFI and Linux tooling  
- Connect components over UNIX sockets, TCP, and Protobuf  
- Ship Flutter UIs optimized for constrained displays on AGL boards  
- Rapid prototypes that go from idea to working product in hours
